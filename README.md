# Plastic Recycling

## Project Description

This full-stack web application was developed as part of a Master's coursework  to address the growing issue of plastic waste near recycling centers. Unlike many conventional projects, this system combines real-time interactivity, geolocation, intelligent support, and payment features in a unified platform.

The application enables users to:
- Search for nearby recycling centers
- View center locations on an interactive map
- Interact with an AI-powered chatbot for assistance
- Donate or pay via a secure payment gateway
- Log in with secure user authentication
- Visualize recycling efforts with data charts

This project demonstrates how full-stack technologies can support environmental sustainability in a practical and user-friendly way.
